# **UI Prototype Proposal**

## **Project Overview**

This proposal outlines the development of a **user interface (UI) prototype** featuring a dynamic data table with a details panel, toolbar controls, notification and dark mode toggles, and an edit modal. The design focuses on usability, modern UI/UX principles, and flexibility to support efficient data management and interaction.

---

## **Objectives**

* Develop a responsive and intuitive UI with a clean grey/dark theme and light mode toggle.
* Display tabular data with infinite scrolling to handle large datasets smoothly.
* Provide a details panel alongside the table to display extended information for the selected row.
* Include category buttons to switch between multiple predefined data sets.
* Add toolbar controls for search, add, edit, delete, and refresh operations.
* Integrate a notification bell icon with badge for alerts.
* Implement a modal popup to edit a selected row’s data with save and cancel options.

---

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Category Buttons**

* Four buttons aligned at the top-left to switch the displayed dataset.
* Active button visually highlighted with a lighter grey background.
* Accessible with keyboard navigation and ARIA roles for screen readers.

### 2. **Toolbar**

* Located above the data table.
* Includes a search input for filtering rows dynamically.
* Action buttons: Add, Edit, Delete, Refresh.
* Edit button disabled until a row is selected.

### 3. **Data Table**

* Displays rows of data with columns: ID, Name, Status.
* Infinite scroll loads more rows as the user scrolls down.
* Rows highlight on hover; selected row is distinctly highlighted.
* Clicking a row selects it and updates the details panel.

### 4. **Details Panel**

* Positioned adjacent to the table at the same horizontal level.
* Displays detailed information in four columns:

  * ID, Name, Status, Email, Phone.
* Updates dynamically based on selected row.

### 5. **Notification Bell Icon**

* Located top-right in the header.
* Includes a red badge to indicate the number of unread notifications.

### 6. **Dark Mode Toggle**

* Allows users to switch between dark and light themes.
* Smooth transition of colors for accessibility and user comfort.

### 7. **Edit Modal Popup**

* Triggered by clicking the Edit button with a row selected.
* Allows editing the **Name** field of the selected row.
* Contains **Save** and **Close** buttons.
* Save updates the table and details panel immediately.
* Modal can be dismissed by clicking outside or using Close.

## **Technical Details**

* **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla)
* **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigable, ARIA roles/labels included.
* **Responsive Design:** Layout adapts to viewport size.
* **Performance:** Infinite scroll supports efficient rendering of large data.
* **Maintainability:** Modular code with clear separation of UI components.

---

## **User Experience Flow**

1. User selects a dataset via category buttons.
2. Table updates with the selected data set’s entries.
3. User searches or scrolls through data; more rows load automatically.
4. Selecting a row displays detailed info in the side panel.
5. Clicking Edit opens a popup to modify the Name field.
6. Save applies changes; Close cancels editing.
7. User can toggle dark mode or monitor notifications via icons.

---

## **Benefits**

* Streamlined data browsing and editing in one interface.
* Reduces clutter by combining summary and detail views.
* Enhances productivity with intuitive controls and feedback.
* Supports accessibility and theming preferences.
* Easily extendable for future features such as multi-column editing or export.

---

## **Next Steps**

* Review prototype with stakeholders.
* Incorporate feedback and expand features as needed.
* Implement backend integration for real data operations.
* Perform usability testing and accessibility audits.
* Deploy UI as part of the larger application framework.


Technologies: React.js (with functional components and hooks), CSS Modules or Styled Components for styling.

Advantages of React:

Component-based architecture enabling reusable, modular UI elements.

Efficient DOM updates through Virtual DOM for better performance.

State management using React hooks (useState, useEffect) for dynamic interactivity.

Easier maintenance and scalability as the app grows.

Compatibility with popular UI libraries and tools for extended functionality.

Styling and Theming:

Implement dark mode toggle using React state and CSS variables or styled themes.

Styling scoped to components to avoid global CSS conflicts.

Infinite Scroll:

Implemented via React state and event listeners on scroll containers.

Accessibility:

Use React’s support for ARIA attributes and keyboard event handling.

Modal Implementation:

Popup edit modal as a controlled React component with props for visibility and data.

Development Considerations
Refactor the current static HTML structure into React components:

<CategoryButtons />

<Toolbar />

<DataTable />

<DetailsPanel />

<NotificationBell />

<DarkModeToggle />

<EditModal />

Manage data sets and UI states (selected row, search query, dark mode) with React state hooks.

Use React context or a state management library (if needed) for cross-component state sharing.
